Upload files to Google Drive.
gdrive.py contains the APIs for Google Drive
backup.py packages the files then calls gdrive.py

FIRST TIME ONLY
1) Before using, you need a valid credentials file from Google.
- https://console.developers.google.com/ -> Credentials
- Create credentials -> OAuth client ID -> Other
- Download the credentials file, and update gdrive.py:CREDENTIALS_FILE

2) Update backup.py:BACKUP_DIR and backup.py:GDRIVE_FOLDER. All folders in BACKUP_DIR
will be zipped and sent to GDRIVE_FOLDER.

3) On first run, browser will open up asking you to signin and link your google account.
This information will be cached at gdrive.py:CLIENT_SECRETS.
Subsequent runs will load the client secretes from this cached file.

SUBSEQUENT BACKUPS
Just do step 2.
